# Wireframing for Non-designers

---

Why bother? You know how your technology works, but designers need to understand how a user will interact with it. A simple wireframe is your visual "functional specification"‚Äîa quick way to show "what goes where" and "what happens next" without getting lost in design details.

# üí° The Three Core Ideas

## 1. It's a Rough, Functional Sketch

Remember that a developer's wireframe is a **rough, black-and-white sketch**, not a polished design. Think of it as a functional outline. To keep things focused on the essentials, always design for a small, mobile screen first by stacking elements vertically. This forces simplicity.

## 2. Use the Simplest Shapes Possible

This keeps the process fast and signals that you're focused on structure, not art.

- **Rectangles:** For screens, buttons, input fields, and display areas.
- **Lines:** To represent text or data.
- **Circles:** For basic icons, like a loading spinner.
- **Arrows:** To show the flow between screens.

## 3. Give Each Screen One Core Goal

Each screen should have **one primary purpose**. It could be "User Inputs Data," "System Displays Results," or "User Confirms Action." If a process is complex, split it into multiple, sequential screens. This prevents confusion for both the designer and the eventual user.

# üó∫Ô∏è How to Sketch

Follow these four simple steps to create a clear, functional wireframe.

## Step 1: Define the Screen's Purpose

Before you draw, ask yourself: What is the main goal of this screen? What inputs does it need from the user? What information will it display back? Answering these questions first provides a clear a blueprint for what you need to draw.

## Step 2: Draw the Mobile-First Layout

Next, sketch the layout on a small canvas, as if designing for a phone. Place simple, labeled rectangles for inputs and buttons, like "API Key Input" or "Submit." Use labeled areas to show where information will appear, such as "API Response Data" or a "Chart Placeholder." Don't worry about how it will look on a desktop; the goal is to capture the core functionality.

## Step 3: Connect Your Screens

Finally, show the complete user journey. Draw your screen sketches as boxes and connect them with arrows to illustrate the flow from one step to the next. This helps the designer see the big picture and understand how a user navigates from the start of the demo to its conclusion.

## Tip: Annotate Briefly, Where Necessary

Add short, plain-language notes only when an element's function isn't obvious. The designer needs to know what things do. For example, you might note that a button "Starts data processing" or that a text area will "Show a data chart." Keep annotations minimal and clear.

# ‚úÖ Best Practices to Remember

To make this process effective, **focus on function, not form**. Every element should relate to either a user input or an information display.

- **Keep it simple:**¬†Avoid any visual design. Your job is functional clarity.
- **Annotate Smartly:**¬†Only add notes that are necessary for designers to understand¬†*what it does*¬†and¬†*why it's there*. Use simple, clear language.
- **Collaborate:**¬†Share your sketches early (whiteboard, paper, simple online tool). Get quick feedback.

# ‚ùå Mistakes to Avoid

- Avoid any design details like colors or specific fonts. This is a functional spec, not a design contest.
- **Don't over-explain.** If a button is labeled "Submit," you don't need to add a note saying "Submits the form."

By following this approach, you can efficiently translate your technical knowledge into a clear, functional plan that empowers designers to do their best work.
