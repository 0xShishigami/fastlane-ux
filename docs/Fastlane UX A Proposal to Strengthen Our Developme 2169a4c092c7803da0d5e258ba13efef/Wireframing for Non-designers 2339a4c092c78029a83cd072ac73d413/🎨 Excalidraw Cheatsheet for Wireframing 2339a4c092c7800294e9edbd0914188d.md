## ⚡ Power-User Tips (Highly Recommended!)

These small tricks make a big difference in speed and precision.

- **Constrain Proportions / Straight Lines:** Hold `Shift` while drawing a rectangle (for a perfect square), circle (for a perfect circle), or line (for horizontal/vertical/45-degree angles).
- **Draw from Center:** Hold `Alt/Option` while drawing a shape to draw it from its center point, rather than a corner.
- **Use the Property Panel (Right Sidebar):** After selecting an element, use the panel on the right to quickly:
    - Change stroke (line thickness)
    - Change background color (keep it grayscale for wireframes!)
    - Adjust `Roughness` (to enhance the hand-drawn look)
    - Change text size or alignment.
