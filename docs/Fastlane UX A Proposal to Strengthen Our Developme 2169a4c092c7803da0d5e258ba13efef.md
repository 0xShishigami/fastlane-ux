# Fastlane UX: A Proposal to Strengthen Our Development Process

> **Objective:** To propose a lightweight process designed to increase development velocity, reduce rework, and enhance the quality of our products.
> 

## **1. Improving Our Development Flow**

Our team consistently ships excellent work. As we've scaled, we've encountered some natural growing pains common in fast-moving companies. This proposal outlines a small adjustment to our process to address these points proactively, helping us build even more effectively.

We have an opportunity to improve in three key areas:

- **Reducing Rework:** Catching misalignments *before* code is written, saving valuable development time.
- **Ensuring Product Quality:** Preventing critical usability issues from reaching late stages.
- **Creating Predictable Flow:** Giving the development team the clarity they need to build with fewer blockers.

A key source of this friction is the occasional lack of a single, clear "source of truth" for a feature's user flow before development begins. This can lead to the ambiguity demonstrated in our recent projects.

## **2. Recent Examples**

### **Case Study 1: Privacy Pools ‚Äì An Opportunity to Align Earlier**

This project shows how small misalignments can compound. Because a finalized user flow wasn't established as the source of truth upfront:

- Development started without a clear interface to build.
- The partner requested redesigns *after* code had already been implemented.

**Impact:** This led to significant rework and delays that could be avoided with a clearer starting point.

### **Case Study 2: EF Wallet ‚Äì An Opportunity to Protect Product Quality**

This project highlights the importance of an early UX review to protect our users and partners. A review late in the process identified:

- **Critical Trust Issue:** Users' private funds were obscured behind a switch. In crypto, if a user can't see their funds, it breaks trust.
- **Serious Usability Flaw:** The "send" flow truncated wallet addresses, creating a risk of irreversible fund loss.

**Impact:** These issues required last-minute fixes. A proactive check could have prevented.

## **3. Introducing Fastlane UX**

This is a proposal to **build right, faster, and eliminate rework** by introducing a simple clarity step.

- **What it is:** A short, async, pre-development step to ensure everyone is aligned.
- **What it is not:** A new layer of bureaucracy or more meetings.

### üöß  **How It Works (TO BE DONE)**

Needs iteration.

| Step | What Happens | Owned By |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **1. User Flow Sketch** | A quick flow diagram with edge cases is drafted. UI Wireframes can also be helpful. | Product Engineer |
| **2. Async Review** | Devs & stakeholders iterate the flow / UI. | Project Team |
| 3. **Document the Product** | Include the revised flow and UI to the Tech Design. | Team Leader |
| **4. Greenlight to Code** | Dev scope is clear, with no blockers. | Team Leader |

### **The Product Engineer Role**

This is a facilitation role designed to support our engineers. It's a hybrid function that drives product clarity and UX quality **before** engineering begins, so developers can focus on what they do best: building.

**Core Responsibilities:**

- Facilitate the **Fastlane UX** process.
- Translate ideas into clear **user flows and edge cases**.
- Create the **"source of truth"** that aligns design, dev, and partners.
- Serve as a resource for developers, providing instant clarity on user flows.

## **4. Why This Matters**

This small change has a big impact on the things our business cares about most.

| Concern | How Fastlane UX Helps |
| --- | --- |
| **üö´ Rework Costs** | Catches all UX/flow issues before development starts. |
| **‚ö†Ô∏è Product Risk** | Prevents critical bugs. |
| **üß© Coordination Overhead** | Creates one clear "source of truth" to eliminate confusion. |
| **üöÄ Shipping Velocity** | Reduces dev questions, blockers, and back-and-forth. |
| **ü§ù Partner Trust** | Improves the polish and consistency of everything we ship. |
