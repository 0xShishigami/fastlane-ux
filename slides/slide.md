# Fastlane UX
## A Proposal to Strengthen Our Development Process

**Objective:** To propose a lightweight process designed to increase development velocity, reduce rework, and enhance the quality of our products.

<!-- An example note -->

---

# The Challenge

Our team consistently ships excellent work, but as we've scaled, we've encountered natural growing pains common in fast-moving companies.

## Key Areas for Improvement

- **üö´ Reducing Rework:** Catching misalignments *before* code is written
- **‚ö†Ô∏è Ensuring Product Quality:** Preventing critical usability issues from reaching late stages  
- **üß© Creating Predictable Flow:** Giving the development team the clarity they need to build with fewer blockers

---

# Recent Case Studies

## Case Study 1: Privacy Pools
**The Problem:** Development started without a clear interface to build, leading to partner-requested redesigns *after* code implementation.

**Impact:** Significant rework and delays that could be avoided with a clearer starting point.

## Case Study 2: EF Wallet  
**The Problem:** Late UX review identified critical issues:
- Users' private funds were obscured behind a switch
- "Send" flow truncated wallet addresses, creating risk of irreversible fund loss

**Impact:** Last-minute fixes required. A proactive check could have prevented these issues.

---

# Introducing Fastlane UX

A proposal to **build right, faster, and eliminate rework** by introducing a simple clarity step.

## What It Is
- A short, async, pre-development step to ensure everyone is aligned
- Focuses on creating a single "source of truth" for user flows

## What It Is NOT
- A new layer of bureaucracy
- More meetings
- A design-heavy process

---

# How Fastlane UX Works

| Step | What Happens | Owned By |
|------|-------------|----------|
| **1. User Flow Sketch** | Quick flow diagram with edge cases is drafted. UI Wireframes can also be helpful. | Product Engineer |
| **2. Async Review** | Devs & stakeholders iterate the flow / UI. | Project Team |
| **3. Document the Product** | Include the revised flow and UI to the Tech Design. | Team Leader |
| **4. Greenlight to Code** | Dev scope is clear, with no blockers. | Team Leader |

---

# The Product Engineer Role

A facilitation role designed to support our engineers. It's a hybrid function that drives product clarity and UX quality **before** engineering begins.

## Core Responsibilities

- Facilitate the **Fastlane UX** process
- Translate ideas into clear **user flows and edge cases**
- Create the **"source of truth"** that aligns design, dev, and partners
- Serve as a resource for developers, providing instant clarity on user flows

---

# Why This Matters

This small change has a big impact on the things our business cares about most.

| Concern | How Fastlane UX Helps |
|---------|----------------------|
| **üö´ Rework Costs** | Catches all UX/flow issues before development starts |
| **‚ö†Ô∏è Product Risk** | Prevents critical bugs |
| **üß© Coordination Overhead** | Creates one clear "source of truth" to eliminate confusion |
| **üöÄ Shipping Velocity** | Reduces dev questions, blockers, and back-and-forth |
| **ü§ù Partner Trust** | Improves the polish and consistency of everything we ship |

---

# User Flow Standards

## Why We Need Standards

- **Clarity & Consistency:** Single, shared language for diagrams eliminates ambiguity
- **Efficiency:** Standardized tools and templates accelerate creation process
- **Quality:** User-centric focus ensures accurate reflection of user experience

---

# Mermaid: Our Source of Truth

Mermaid is a text-based tool for generating diagrams and charts. We use it because it is:

- **Easy to Edit:** Quickly modify flows by changing text, not manually realigning shapes
- **Integration-Friendly:** Can be embedded directly into documentation platforms

---

# Standard Shapes and Meanings

| Mermaid | Intent Type | Description | Shape |
|-------------|----------------|-------------|-------|
| `[/‚Ä¶/]` | UI Trigger | UI action initiated by user (click, submit, etc.) | Parallelogram |
| `[\‚Ä¶\]` | UI Prompt | Request for user input or confirmation | Parallelogram alt |
| `[‚Ä¶]` | System Output | UI feedback shown to user | Rectangle |
| `[[‚Ä¶]]` | Processing | System logic or computational task | Double rectangle |
| `{‚Ä¶}` | Decision | Condition or branching logic | Diamond |
| `(((‚Ä¶)))` | Error | Error state or user-facing error message | Double circle |

---

# Mermaid Flowchart Example

# FigJam: Our Collaboration Space

While Mermaid is our source of truth, FigJam is our space for ideation, collaboration, and presentation.

## When to Use FigJam

- Brainstorming initial flow ideas
- Collaborating in real-time with PMs, engineers, and stakeholders
- Presenting a flow during design reviews

**Template:** [User Flow Standard FigJam Board](https://www.figma.com/board/ZOdKsuqIg9Oo4ISCFtTpSG/User-flow-standard?node-id=0-1&t=ADjb9pLhMhNKEVKE-1)

# AI-Assisted Workflow

## Sequence Diagram to Flowchart Conversion

We use AI to translate technical `sequenceDiagram` into user-centric `flowchart`, especially useful when working from engineering specs.

### The Process
1. Start with technical sequence diagram
2. Use AI prompt to convert to user-centered flowchart
3. Follow our visual intent standards
4. Focus on user perspective, not backend APIs

---

# User Flow Example: Stealth Transaction
<style scoped>
.kroki-image-container {
    transform: scale(0.75);
  }
</style>
```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
actor a as Alice
participant aw as Alice's Wallet
participant rpc as Ethereum Client (rpc provider)
participant acc2 as Bos's Stealth Address

a->>aw: Wants to send 1 ETH<br/>and enters bob public address
aw->>rpc: check if bob has a stealth meta-key
rpc->>aw: return Bob's stealth meta-key
aw->>aw: generate a new stealth address for bob
aw->>rpc: send 1 ETH to Bob's stealth address
rpc-->>acc2: now this address has 1 ETH
aw->>rpc: Publish the ephemereal pubkey in the registry
aw->>a: display the success modal
```

---

# User Flow Example: Output (Flowchart)
<style scoped>
.kroki-image-container {
    transform: scale(0.7) translateY(-15%);
  }
</style>
```mermaid
flowchart TD
    A[/Enters recipient address and send amount *1/] --> B
    B[[Processing transaction *2]] --> C{Transaction Successful?}
    C -->|Yes| D[Displays transaction success message *3]
    C -->|No| E(((Transaction Failed)))
```

## Supplementary Notes
- **1. Send Details:** User provides recipient's public address and ETH amount
- **2. Stealth Processing:** Wallet checks stealth meta-key, generates stealth address, sends ETH, publishes ephemeral key
- **3. Privacy Benefit:** Observer cannot link transaction to recipient's main address

# Wireframing for Non-designers

## The Three Core Ideas

1. **It's a Rough, Functional Sketch** - Not polished design, but functional outline
2. **Use the Simplest Shapes Possible** - Keeps process fast and focused on structure
3. **Give Each Screen One Core Goal** - Each screen has one primary purpose

---

# How to Sketch Wireframes

## Step 1: Define the Screen's Purpose
Ask: What is the main goal? What inputs does it need? What information will it display?

## Step 2: Draw the Mobile-First Layout
Sketch on small canvas as if designing for phone. Use simple, labeled rectangles.

## Step 3: Connect Your Screens
Show complete user journey with arrows between screen boxes.

---

# Wireframing Best Practices

## ‚úÖ Do This
- **Keep it simple:** Avoid any visual design
- **Annotate Smartly:** Only add notes necessary for understanding function
- **Collaborate:** Share sketches early for quick feedback

## ‚ùå Avoid This
- Design details like colors or specific fonts
- Over-explaining obvious elements
- Getting caught up in visual perfection

---
